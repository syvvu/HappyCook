# Happy Cook 🥘

Hello:) I'm a UCSD Computer Science student, wrapping up my journey and set to graduate in June 2024. Over the summer, I dove into a comprehensive Udemy course - "Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course", and "Happy Cook" is the delightful outcome!

## About the Project 📖

Have you ever been in that situation where you stare into your pantry or fridge and think, "What can I possibly make out of these?" As a college student, I've been there countless times. So, I built Happy Cook. Input the ingredients you've got, and it'll show you possible recipes you can whip up, complete with YouTube tutorials. It's a simple tool, but I believe it can make a difference for cooking beginners like me.

### Features 🌟

- **Ingredient Selection**: Tell us what you have, and we'll work our magic.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: We show both exact matches and close matches.
- **YouTube Integration**: A direct link to a tutorial for each recipe.

## How It's Made 🛠️

This is a full-stack project, and I've used a range of technologies:
- Frontend: React (hosted on [Vercel](https://happycook.vercel.app/))
- Backend: Node.js, with data stored in MongoDB (hosted on Heroku)

I manually gathered recipe data and stored it in a Google Sheet. To integrate this data into the app, I used an API key to pull the information and subsequently stored it in MongoDB.
